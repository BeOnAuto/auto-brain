# Contributing to auto-brain

Thanks for helping build the runtime for business brains. Bug reports, ideas and pull requests are all welcome.

## Before you start

- **Found a vulnerability?** Don't open an issue. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Bugs and ideas** go in [issues](https://github.com/BeOnAuto/auto-brain/issues/new/choose). For anything bigger than a small fix, open an issue first so we can agree on the approach before you write code.
- **The CLA.** auto-brain is [source-available under ELv2](LICENSING.md), and Auto also sells commercial licenses. So every contributor signs the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md) once. The CLA bot asks on your first pull request; reply with the sentence it gives you.
- Everyone taking part follows the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Set up

Install pnpm 10 or newer as the [quick start](docs/get-started/local.md) shows. It fetches the Node.js and pnpm versions the repository pins and runs everything on them, so you do not install Node.js. `nvm use` reads `.nvmrc` if your editor's tooling wants the same Node.js on your `PATH`; the server runs on pnpm's managed runtime either way.

```bash
pnpm install          # also installs the git hooks
pnpm dev              # the server on http://localhost:8080, reloading on save
pnpm test:watch       # every package's tests, rerun on save
pnpm typecheck:watch  # TypeScript over the whole repo
pnpm check            # everything CI checks; run it before you push
```

Node runs the TypeScript sources directly, so there's no build step.

## Documentation

Runtime guides live in `docs/` and are published as part of [on.auto/docs](https://on.auto/docs/). Change the docs in the same pull request as behavior changes. The public preview needs no private repository or service credentials:

```sh
pnpm docs:dev
pnpm docs:check
```

The preview opens under `/docs/`. Read [Documentation contributions](docs/contributing/documentation.md) for navigation, links, status labels and the publication contract. Package READMEs keep code entry points and test instructions. Detailed setup and implementation guides live in [docs/engineering/](docs/engineering/index.md), and architecture decisions in `docs/decisions/`; both are excluded from the public build and website import.

## How the code is written

[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) holds the full rules. The ones that matter most for a first pull request:

- **Every file is held to 100% test coverage.** Write the test; coverage-ignore comments and coverage excludes are rejected.
- **The lint and TypeScript rules are strict and stay that way.** No `any`, no `as` assertions, no `@ts-ignore`, no disable directives.
- **TypeScript must be erasable**, because Node strips the types at runtime. That means no `enum`, `namespace`, parameter properties or decorators. Relative imports include the `.ts` extension.
- **Tests sit next to the code** as `*.test.ts` and test behaviour through the public interface, with injected fakes rather than mocks.

## Commits and pull requests

- **Commits are [conventional](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) with a scope,** for example `feat(reasoning): render the liquid body against the brain`.
  - The scope is a package or capability folder name (`server`, `config`, `ledger`, `reasoning`, ...), or one of `global`, `deps`, `ci` and `release`.
  - `pnpm commit` walks you through it, and a git hook checks every message.
- **The pull request title matters most.** Pull requests are squash-merged, so the title becomes the commit on `main` and the changelog entry. CI checks it too.
- **CI must pass, then the pull request merges through the merge queue.** CI runs the full `pnpm check`, builds and smoke-tests the container, and audits the workflows. Keep each pull request to one change.

## Adding a function or workflow adapter

Function and workflow implementations live in `capabilities/<name>`. The shared `Capability` interface is their low-level runtime adapter contract, including custom extension adapters. It is not a product category. Each implemented adapter is a workspace package:

- `package.json` named `@beonauto/<name>`, with `"exports": { ".": "./src/index.ts" }` and `lint`, `typecheck` and `test` scripts. Copy them from `packages/config`.
- `README.md` saying what the adapter runs and how it reads and writes the ledger.
- `src/index.ts` as its public interface, with tests beside the code.

Open an issue before adding an adapter or implementing a planned function type. Follow [Brain terminology](docs/concepts/terminology.md) for resource names, and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the names in code. Workflow coordination is separate from the five function types.
