# Create your first brain

A first brain holds one reasoning function that the person can run and see the answer of. Read the reasoning-function guide with get_guide before you write the function.

1. Call list_brains to see the brains of the org, and list_models where this connection has it to see the models this server can call.
2. Ask the person what the brain is for, in their own words, and what its first function should do, such as checking a campaign brief for an audience, a budget and a measurable goal. When more than one model is offered, ask which to use; a model whose id ends in `*` stands for many and is not a model to run.
3. Create the brain with create_brain, with an id of lowercase letters, digits and hyphens and the person's words on what it is for, or use the brain they name when list_brains shows it.
4. Write the reasoning function in the format of the reasoning-function guide: its model, a description, an input schema with the fields the person will give, and a prompt. When it should use a tool server's tools, follow the give-tools recipe: to learn what a tool answers, test it with test_tool_call, and never make a function to look. Show the person the whole document and ask whether to save it.
5. Once they agree, save it with create_definition, `type` reasoning. A name that is taken is refused; choose another with the person rather than changing the function that has it.
6. Ask for an input, run the function with run_definition, and tell the person what it answered, in their words.
7. Tell the person what they can do next: run it again on another input, change it, give it tools with the give-tools recipe, make the brain remember its answers with the remember recipe, or run it on a schedule with the schedule recipe.
